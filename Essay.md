## Tiny Composer – A Symphony of Code and Creativity

I am a student working as a software developer with a passion for building cross-platform mobile applications. Over the years, I have worked with various technologies, including Kotlin, C, Java, and JavaScript, which have given me a well-rounded perspective on software development. My professional journey has been shaped by a love for problem-solving and innovation, extending beyond work to hobbies such as composing music and exploring generative AI.

The idea for Tiny Composer stems from my fascination with both music and technology. As a classically trained musician, I have often envisioned a tool that could seamlessly bridge creativity and AI, empowering users to craft melodies and harmonies effortlessly. My recent exploration of jazz music deepened my passion for creating and testing new musical ideas, inspiring me to bring this vision to life. With Kotlin’s multiplatform capabilities, I saw an opportunity to realize this dream, delivering a robust, intuitive app for both Android and iOS users.

Tiny Composer leverages the power of Kotlin Multiplatform and AI through the Gemini AI SDK, enabling users to generate chord progressions and melodies using natural language prompts. The app utilizes my custom-built MikroSoundFont library for MIDI operations and soundfont-based synthesis, providing audio playback with an option to pick the instruments that are playing. The user interface is crafted with Compose Multiplatform, offering a seamless and responsive experience across devices.

With this application, I set out to create a tool that drives my creativity—a way to not only write but also play the music I envision. I am immensely proud to have made this possible for myself and others.

Through Tiny Composer, I aim to democratize music creation, making it accessible to everyone—regardless of their musical expertise—while showcasing the power and versatility of Kotlin Multiplatform.
